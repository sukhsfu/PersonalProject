## Tools used and API's integrated:-
  Android Studio, Firebase, Glide, Admob ads, Facebook Native ads.
  
## App Overview:-
 This is social media app, similar to Instagram and facebook.<br /> 
*  upload memes, which will be posted on timeline of users following you.
*  like a meme, follow other users.
*  get a coin, when someone likes meme posted by you.
*  can change your username and profile picture any number of times.
*  profile activity- where you can see your profile picture, username, total coins earned, number of user's following you and also number of user's followed by you.
  
## More technical details:- 
* Firebase authentication is used to keep record of the user's signing in. 
* when user open's the app, he reaches the main activity, where his authentication is checked and then moved to display activity or login activity accordingly.
* display activity has four fragments :
>>      GalleryFragment- for user to upload memes to firebase database.
>>      HomeFragment- Fragment containing the recyclerview to display memes on the tab.
>>      SettingsFragment- change username and profile picture.
>>      Profile- user can view his profile.
  Users can move back and forth accross these fragments through navigation controller.
* firebase realtime database is used to keep track of likes/unlikes on the meme, user followers and memes uploaded.
* Memes are stored in the firebase in queue data structure using the time (upto nanoseconds) they were uploaded.  
* firebase cloud function is triggered everytime memes reaches the certain maximum limit in the bucket and deleting half of the memes, thus making the room for        newer ones. 
   
## New experiences gained:-<br /> 
* paging/caching- Without pre/postcaching activities usually loads the data currently on the screen. I used paging to preload the tabs recylcerviewer view will       use as user scrolls down. Thus providing smooth experience for user's to scroll.
* Integration of admob and facebook's API's.
* Full stack experience and working with realtime data using firebase database and cloud functions.
